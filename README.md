1. Overview

The Meal Suggestion App is an Android application developed using Kotlin in Android Studio. It helps users quickly decide on meals based on the time of day. The app provides meal suggestions based on user input while keeping the experience engaging and simple.

2. Purpose

Hera, a close friend, struggles to decide what to eat during busy days. This app simplifies meal choices by providing meal suggestions based on the time of day. Users enter a specific time period (e.g., "Morning" or "Dinner"), and the app suggests a meal accordingly.

3. Features

-User-Friendly Interface: Simple and engaging UI for effortless meal selection.

-Meal Suggestions: Provides meal recommendations based on the time of day.

-Reset Functionality: Allows users to clear their input and reset meal suggestions.

-Error Handling: Ensures users enter valid time periods and provides constructive feedback if they input incorrect data.

4. Design Considerations

-User Interface (UI)
-The app features a text box for users to input the time of day.

-A display area shows the corresponding meal suggestion.

-A reset button clears the input and displayed meal suggestions.

5. Meal Suggestion Logic

The app uses if statements to determine meal recommendations:

-Morning → Breakfast (e.g., Eggs)

-Mid-Morning → Light snack (e.g., Fruit)

-Afternoon → Lunch (e.g., Sandwich)

-Mid-Afternoon → Quick bites (e.g., Cake)

-Dinner → Main course (e.g., Pasta)

-After Dinner Snack → Dessert (e.g., Ice cream)

6. Error Handling

-Users must enter a valid time of day.

-If an invalid input is entered, the-app displays an error message guiding the user to input a correct value.

7. GitHub & GitHub Actions

GitHub Repository:
-The source code is hosted on GitHub to enable version control and collaboration.

-The repository includes structured project files, including the Kotlin source code and XML layout files.

GitHub Actions:
-Automated Testing: GitHub Actions can be set up to run tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring app stability.

-Continuous Integration (CI): The workflow can include build checks to validate the app's code and prevent issues before deployment.

-Deployment Automation: GitHub Actions can be configured to build and release APK files automatically.
